'''
Generally, if a physical quantity is divided by itself, 
the physical quantity obtained should be the Identity quantity. 
However, the plane angle is a physical quantity obtained by dividing the length by the length. 
It has a clear geometric and physical meaning, 
and it cannot be simply regarded as an Identity quantity. 
In order to distinguish them in the class library, 
it is necessary to distinguish the two physical quantities expressing the angle. 
In fact, these two physical quantities are also different. 
As the length of the dividend, it is the length of the arc on the plane stretched by the angle, 
and as the divisor, it is the length of the radius of the arc. The two are geometrically different. 
Therefore, borrow their differences in the design of the class library 
to achieve the type of calculation of physical quantities. 
For solid angles, Moment of force, etc., there are also such issues that need to be dealt with. 
Therefore, the classes RadialLength and RadialAreaType are specially designed in the class library 
to solve such problems.
